    <div class="faq-grid">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How quickly can Kleva be implemented?</h3>
        <p>
          Implementation takes 2-3 weeks from contract signing. This includes system integration, 
          AI training on your specific use cases, compliance setup, and team onboarding. 
          We handle all the technical heavy lifting.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What systems does Kleva integrate with?</h3>
        <p>
          Kleva integrates with all major core banking systems, CRMs, and collection platforms. 
          We've built connectors for SAP, Oracle, Salesforce, and custom systems. 
          If you have an API, we can integrate.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is Kleva compliant with LATAM regulations?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. We're fully compliant with debt collection regulations in Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, 
          Guatemala, Ecuador, and Peru. Our AI is trained on country-specific compliance requirements 
          and automatically adapts its approach based on jurisdiction.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does pricing work?</h3>
        <p>
          We charge per minute of AI agent time, with volume discounts starting at 50,000 minutes per month. 
          Most clients see 70% cost reduction compared to human agents. 
          We provide a detailed ROI calculation during your intro call.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What languages does Kleva support?</h3>
        <p>
          Native Spanish, Portuguese, and English. Our AI understands regional dialects and slang 
          across Latin America. We don't use Google Translate - this is real, contextual language 
          understanding built from millions of actual collection calls.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How many calls can Kleva handle simultaneously?</h3>
        <p>
          Unlimited. Our infrastructure scales automatically. We currently process 900,000+ minutes 
          monthly and can handle thousands of simultaneous calls without any degradation in quality 
          or response time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What happens to complex cases the AI can't handle?</h3>
        <p>
          Kleva automatically escalates complex cases to your human team with full context and 
          recommendations. The AI learns from how your team handles these cases, continuously 
          improving its ability to handle similar situations in the future.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do we monitor performance and results?</h3>
        <p>
          You get real-time dashboards showing call volume, recovery rates, payment promises, 
          and agent performance. Every call is recorded and transcribed. You can listen to any 
          conversation and see exactly what was said and agreed upon.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why do debtors prefer talking to AI?</h3>
        <p>
          AI agents have infinite patience, never judge, and offer solutions instead of threats. 
          They're available 24/7, speak clearly, and give debtors time to explain their situation. 
          Our data shows 25% higher payment rates compared to human agents.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What's your track record?</h3>
        <p>
          We're processing 900,000+ minutes monthly with clients like Vana, Tandem, and Diners Club. 
          Average results: 25% higher recovery rates, 70% cost reduction, zero agent turnover. 
          We've collected millions in previously uncollectable debt.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is Kleva different from other AI solutions?</h3>
        <p>
          We're built specifically for LATAM collections, not adapted from US solutions. 
          We understand cultural nuances, local regulations, and regional payment methods. 
          Our founders personally invested $100K+ to prove this works before taking any outside funding.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can we try Kleva before committing?</h3>
        <p>
          We offer a pilot program where you can test Kleva on a subset of accounts. 
          See the results for yourself before scaling. Most pilots convert to full implementations 
          within 30 days after seeing the ROI.

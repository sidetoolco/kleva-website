## Implementation and Best Practice

A/B testing starts with good test design. Each test should start with a clear hypothesis of what will improve performance. This hypothesis should be specific and measurable so you can validate or reject based on test results. Single variable isolation ensures results can be attributed to the change and proper sample size calculations ensure statistical validity. Expert teams can assist in developing test ideas to enhance the effectiveness of testing strategies.

Data is the foundation of good test results. The platform helps teams set up tracking, validate their data collection and manage user cookies.

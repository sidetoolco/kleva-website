## Voice Authentication: The Basics

Voice authentication, also known as voice biometrics, uses the uniqueness of an individual’s voice as an identifier. This includes physical attributes (like vocal tract shape) and behavioral patterns (like speaking rhythm and accent). When used with Vapi AI’s technology, voice authentication can be a secure and user-friendly way to verify identity.

## Understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, facilitating more intuitive and human-like interactions. In the context of Vapi, NLP powers the voice assistant’s ability to comprehend and respond to user queries effectively. This capability is essential for creating a seamless user experience, as it allows the system to process and understand spoken language accurately, making interactions more natural and efficient.

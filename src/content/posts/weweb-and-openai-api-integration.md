## The Holy Trinity: Core Features That Matter

Have a co-writer that never runs out of ideas. The Text Completion feature does just that, generating everything from marketing copy to sample data. Whether you’re writing product descriptions or brainstorming content ideas, this feature is your AI powered writing sidekick.

### DALL-E Integration: Where Words Become Pictures

Image generation just got a whole lot easier with the [DALL-E](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/) model integration. Need a unique hero image for your landing page? Just describe what you want and watch as AI turns your words into images. No more stock photo searching or expensive custom illustrations.

### Chat Completion: Building Interactive Experiences

The ChatGPT model integration allows for conversational interfaces that maintain context throughout user interactions. This means you can build intelligent chatbots, interactive FAQs and personalized user assistance systems that actually understand and remember conversation context.

## OpenAI API: Frequently Asked Questions

### Is There an OpenAI API?

Yes, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) has an API that powers the WeWeb plugin. This API gives you access to:

- GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 for text generation

- DALL-E for image creation

- Whisper for speech-to-text conversion

It is crucial to enter the API key securely to ensure the protection of sensitive information when making API calls. The WeWeb plugin makes it easy to use these powerful features in your projects.

### Can I Use OpenAI API for Commercial Use?

Yes! The OpenAI API is available for commercial use with clear usage policies and pricing. When using the WeWeb plugin for commercial use, you should:

- Read OpenAI’s usage policies and terms of service

- Monitor your API usage to manage costs

- Implement rate limiting in your app

- Comply with OpenAI’s content policies

### Is OpenAI API as Good as ChatGPT?

The OpenAI API powers ChatGPT and has several advantages:

- Latest models (including GPT-4 with API subscription)

- More consistent and reliable performance

- More control over response formatting

- Ability to customize the AI’s behavior with detailed prompts

- Features that the ChatGPT web interface doesn’t have

By mastering OpenAI's APIs and crafting effective prompts, users can leverage the full potential of the OpenAI plugin within WeWeb, enhancing their web projects with advanced AI functionalities.

### Is OpenAI API Free to Use?

The OpenAI API is pay-as-you-go:

- New users get a free credit allocation to start

- After that, it’s pay-as-you-go (tokens for text, images for DALL-E)

- Different models have different pricing tiers

- You can monitor and control usage with rate limits

- You can save costs with the WeWeb plugin

### Security First: Designed In

One of the best things about the OpenAI plugin in WeWeb is the integrated security by design. Unlike traditional REST APIs, all API calls are handled server-side, so your API keys and sensitive prompts never hit the client side. This means it’s impossible for a malicious user to extract your API credentials through browser developer tools.

### Get Started: Easy AI Integration

Installing the OpenAI plugin in WeWeb is a breeze:

1. Go to **Plugins > Extensions** in your WeWeb dashboard

2. Find and add the **OpenAI plugin**

3. Enter your OpenAI API credentials

4. Configure your secure prompts at the plugin level

### Cost Management

To optimize your OpenAI API usage and costs:

- Cache common queries

- Use shorter prompts

- Monitor usage

- Set up usage alerts and limits

- Choose the right model for the task

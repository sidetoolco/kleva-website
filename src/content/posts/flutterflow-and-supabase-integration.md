# FlutterFlow and Supabase: Build Modern Apps in a Flash

In today’s fast paced development world finding tools that speed up app creation while keeping functionality intact is like finding gold. Enter [FlutterFlow](https://www.flutterflow.io/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) – a game changing combination that’s changing the way we build mobile apps. The flutterflow integration with Supabase streamlines app development by allowing users to connect Supabase easily, combining Supabase’s backend services with FlutterFlow’s visual tools. Let’s get into why this duo is making waves in the development community.

## The Power Players: Meet FlutterFlow and Supabase

### FlutterFlow: Where Visual Meets Functionality in Your FlutterFlow Project

Imagine building a complex mobile app without drowning in code. That’s FlutterFlow’s promise. Built on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), Google’s popular UI toolkit, FlutterFlow turns the code heavy process of app development into a visual experience.

What’s special about FlutterFlow?
